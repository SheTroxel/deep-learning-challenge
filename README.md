# deep-learning-challenge
For this challenge, the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. Using machine learning and neural networks, create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From the Alphabet Soup's business team, I received a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization.
